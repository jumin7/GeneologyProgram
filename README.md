# Project: Genealogy App

## Overview

This was my final project which allows a user to record a genealogy for their family. Consider the
following *user story* that illustrates the purpose of the app from the
perspective of the end-user.

> As a user, I want to record my ancestry so that my family can understand
> where we come from.

## Features

### Version 0.2

- Save the current genealogy to a file on disk in the following format:
    ```
    Alice User,03/02/01
    Bob User,02/15/63:Carol Operator,03/01/75
    Dave User,04/01/00:Erin Coder,05/18/99:Frank User,06/18/97
    Grace User,01/02/34:Heidi Vendor,10/20/30:Ivan Operator,12/23/45:Judy Maintainer,05/14/50
    ```
- Load a previously saved genealogy from a file on disk.
- Gets the name and birth date together on one line when adding a person
- Handles some errors gracefully.
    - invalid/empty command selection
    - empty name when looking up a person
    - empty or invalid input when adding a person
    - attempting to load before the family tree has been saved

### Version 0.1

- Enter the name of the owner when creating a new genealogy.
- Add full names and birth dates for siblings, parents, and grandparents.
- Look up a name to retrieve that person's birth date and relationship to the owner.
- Remove a person's data from the genealogy by name.
- Display the genealogy as text in the following format:
    ```
